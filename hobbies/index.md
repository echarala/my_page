Life without hobbies is impossible.

One of my favorite hobbies is playing music. 
Having studied jazz guitar, classical and jazz
 harmony, I became a member of a jazz/blues/fusion 
trio named "Short Fuse". Back to those days, we
were performing in clubs as a trio playing jazz 
standards and other pieces.

We recorded a live demo (more than 10 years ago!) 
and some pieces are the following (you might need
flash player installed in your browser): 


 - [Chromazone]({{site.baseurl}}/hobbies/track1.mp3) (by Mike Stern)
 - [Nardis]({{site.baseurl}}/hobbies/track2.mp3) (by Miles Davis)
 - [Lenny]({{site.baseurl}}/hobbies/track3.mp3) (by Stevie Ray Vaughan)

Enjoy!

My other favorite hobby is electronics including 
fixing/repairing electronic devices and building
 tube amplifiers. Actually, my interest in electronics
has started since I was 9 years old. I was trying to 
understand how electronic devices work. However, many
 years have passed until I realized that something 
deeper is behind which is related, of course, with 
Science. Still posing the following simple questions:
 How and why things work?
