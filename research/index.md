<h3>Research</h3>

I am an applied/computational mathematician who has been developing and employing
analytical and computational techniques for studying the <em>existence</em>, 
<em>stability</em> and <em>bifurcations</em> as well as <em>spatio-temporal 
evolution</em> of <em>[nonlinear waves](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Linear_and_nonlinear_waves)</em>.
The fields my research revolves around include [Optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics), 
[Condensed matter physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensed_matter_physics) 
(such as [atomic Bose-Einstein Condensates](https://journals.aps.org/rmp/pdf/10.1103/RevModPhys.74.1131)  (BECs)),
[Materials Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science) (an example
is the [granular crystal]({{site.baseurl}}/research/granular_crystals.pdf)),
[Fluid Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_mechanics) 
([Draupner/rogue/freak waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_wave)),
[Nuclear Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics) as well as
[Einstein's theory of Gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity).

I am co-organizing with Professors [Panos Kevrekidis](https://people.math.umass.edu/~kevrekid/) 
(UMass Amherst) and [Christopher Chong](http://www.bowdoin.edu/~cchong/) (Bowdoin College) 
a webinar on [Nonlinear Waves and Coherent Structures](https://sites.google.com/view/nwcswebinar/home).
