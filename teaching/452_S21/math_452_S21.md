<h4><b><b>MATH 452: Numerical Analysis II (Section 1) </b></b></h4>
Welcome to the course webpage for Math 452! This course is the second 
part of the Numerical Analysis sequence (Math 451-Math 452-Math 453) 
offered at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and it complements itself the topics 
covered in Math 451. In particular, the following topics (not necessarily 
in the order listed) will be covered: Finite difference schemes for 
steady-state boundary value problems, numerical methods for ordinary 
differential equations (ODEs) as well as methods for initial and boundary 
value problems (IVPs and IBVPs, respectively) containing partial differential 
equations (PDEs). The use of <b><b>MATLAB</b></b> will be adopted in this 
class where practical implementations of the methods discussed in this course 
will be presented.
