<h4><b><b>MATH 453: Numerical Optimization (Section 1) </b></b></h4>
Welcome to the course webpage for Math 453! This course is the 
third part of the Numerical Analysis sequence covering foundational numerical 
methods/algorithms used for optimization problems. 
In particular, we will discuss about Unconstrained and Constrained optimization
as well as linear programming. Furthermore, we will discuss about implementations 
of the underlying algorithms in <b><b>MATLAB</b></b>, where the latter will be 
taught through increasingly complex codes over the quarter. In this web page and
associated links, you will find important information about Math 453 including
(but not limited to) syllabus, homework problems, MATLAB tutorials and important 
dates, among others.
