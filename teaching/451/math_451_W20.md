<h4><b><b>MATH 451: Numerical Analysis I (Section 1) </b></b></h4>
Welcome to the course webpage for Math 451! This course is the 
first part of the Numerical Analysis sequence (Math 451-Math 452-Math 453)
covering foundational numerical methods/algorithms used for problems that arise in 
many scientific fields. In particular, we will discuss upon the accuracy of 
numerical methods, their stability and efficiency will be considered in 
this course. Furthermore, we will discuss about implementations of the underlying algorithms
in <b><b>MATLAB</b></b>, where the latter will be taught through increasingly 
complex codes over the quarter. In this web page and associated links, you will 
find important information about Math 451 including (but not limited to) syllabus, 
homework problems, MATLAB tutorials and important dates, among others.
